This is a todo app made with react-js and Java Spring.

The directory todo contains the spring part and todo-front contains the react part.
In order to have the spring working you'll have to change the database connection in spring.
To do it change the spring.data.mongodb.uri in todo/todo/src/main/resources/application.properties.
